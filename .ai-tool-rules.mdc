# AI Tool Rules

- Task ownership: The tool manages branches under prefix `ai-tool/`.
- Do not modify files while a task is `running`.
- Preferred formatting: run the tool's formatter before committing.
- Test policy: always re-run tests after applying fixes.
- Visual checks: when `ORCH_VISUAL_URL` is configured, review diffs before merge.
